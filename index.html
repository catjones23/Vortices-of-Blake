      <h1>Blake's Vortex and Analogies of Reading in <i>Milton: A Poem in Two Books</i></h1>
    </div>
    <br>
    <div class="intro">
      <h3>Introduction</h3>
      <p>    William Blake’s epic poem <i>Milton: A Poem in Two Books</i> (1810) follows its titular hero on a quest to redeem his creativity, that after one hundred years in heaven, he realises he had neglected during his life on earth. Travelling through a vortex before falling to earth as a star, Milton enters Blake’s foot on landing and assumes a creative influence over him. This literal collision of poets, one of whom is the poem’s actual author, establishes the themes of creativity, imagination, literary legacy and history fundamental to the poem, as well as asserting its deeply self-reflexive ambitions. Made explicit in the poem’s preface, these ambitions are to throw off a creative and imaginative dependence on the classical examples of ‘Greek and Roman Models’ which Blake believes had come to dominate the contemporary literary landscape as the predominant source of inspiration and instead to renew through reading, an independent English imagination.</p>

      <p>This dissertation will focus on Blake’s vortex motif, arguing that it functions as an extended analogy for the transformative process of reading. That just as the vortex transforms those who are sucked into it in Milton, texts similarly draw in and transform the minds that read them. Applying this analogy to various levels of language—beginning with words and fragments, then passages, and finally considering the entire long poem—the dissertation will consider content and form as working in tandem towards Blake’s twin ambitions to both depict his hero’s creative and spiritual transformation whilst stimulating a simultaneous transformation of imagination within the minds of his readers.</p>
      <p>The following diagrams correlate to arguments set out within the body of the dissertation. They are intended to be viewed after reading these critical arguments and before proceeding to the discussion sections.</p>

                <b>Chapter One: Active Texts and Passive Reading</b>
                  <br>
                  <p>Chapter one will set up a central problem of the poem, that is whether reading is an active or passive experience, considering Nelson Hilton’s idea that the word ‘vortex’ in Milton is a kind of word-text that enacts what it describes. </p>

                <b>Chapter Two: Active Reading and Resistant Texts</b>
                <p>Chapter two will develop the argument that reading consists of a tension between the activity and passivity of the reader relative to the text, through a consideration of the expectations generated by prosody and the implications of their respective fulfilment or disappointment.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Broadening its focus to consider longer passages, chapter three will discuss the various choices available to the reader when they approach the long poem and how these choices imply conceptualisations of the long poem as either a temporal or spatial form. </p>

                  <br>
                <p>Chapter four will think specifically about the famous vortex passage and the experience of being imaginatively engrossed in the reading process, as well as the implications of this on the reader’s sense of time.</p>

                <b>Chapter Five: After Reading: The Transformative Powers of Reading</b>
                <p>Finally, chapter five will zoom out to reflect on the experience of reading the long poem as a whole, and the potential for reading an entire text to transform the reader’s mind.</p>
